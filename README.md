## Content
>- `main.py`: python script that calls the functions and the classes from the modules below and saves the resulting plots in images (png);
>- `functions.py`: python script file which contains all the functions for building graphs, make simulations and evaluating performances;
>- `topologies.py`: python module where we implemented the classes for the used topologies.
